    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A filling Chicago-style pizza, the ingredients are layered the opposite
      way to Italian pizza - cheese first, then toppings, then sauce.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>dried active yeast 1 tsp</li>
      <li>cream of tartar 1/4 tsp</li>
      <li>golden caster sugar 1 tsp</li>
      <li>groundnut oil 2 tbsp</li>
      <li>olive oil 1 tbsp</li>
      <li>strong bread flour 250g</li>
      <li>sea salt flakes 1/5 tsp</li>
      <li>
        good-quality plum tomatoes 400g tin, (use San Marzano if you can find
        them)
      </li>
      <li>golden caster sugar 1/2 tsp</li>
      <li>oregano 1 tsp</li>
      <li>basil a handful</li>
      <li>garlic 1 clove, crushed</li>
      <li>pecorino 4 tbsp, finely grated</li>
      <li>grated mozzarella 125g</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the sauce, drain the tomatoes (keep the juice for bloody marys
        or freeze to use later). Put the drained tomatoes in a bowl and squish
        with your hands until mashed.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Mix with the rest of the ingredients and leave while you make the dough.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Put the yeast, cream of tartar, sugar and oil in a bowl with 150ml warm
        water. Mix then leave for 5 minutes in a warm place.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Gradually add the flour and salt, bringing it together as a dough (add a
        little more water if you need to). Tip out onto a floured board and
        knead for 2-3 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Put in an oiled bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave in a warm place for
        an hour.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Oil a metal cake or pie tin approx 23cm x 4cm deep.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Punch down the dough, knead a couple of times then roll and stretch it
        out to line the tin.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Cover the base of the pizza with 2
        tbsp of the pecorino.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Cover with the mozzarella. Top with the sauce and the rest of the
        pecorino.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake for 35-40 minutes until the edges of the dough are crisp and golden
        and the filling is bubbling.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Rest for 5 minutes before cutting into wedges.</li>
    </ol>
