    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Flaky puff pastry is filled with chocolate-hazelnut spread and all-fruit
      raspberry spread in this delectable treat. I concocted this on a whim one
      afternoon, and after one bite, I knew it was one for the books! Simple,
      elegant, and delicious.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (17.25 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons chocolate hazelnut spread</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all fruit raspberry jam</li>
      <li>beaten Â¼ cup confectioners' sugar for dusting (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Unfold the puff pastry sheets on a lightly floured surface. Cut each one
        into thirds along the fold lines. Roll each strip of dough out to about
        16 inches long, and cut strips into thirds.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Spread some of the hazelnut spread onto one half of each rectangle to
        within 1/2 inch of the edge. Spread about 1/2 teaspoon of the raspberry
        jam over the hazelnut spread. Brush the edges with egg, and fold over
        the other side to enclose the filling. Press the edges firmly to seal.
        Repeat with the remaining rectangles. Use a sharp knife to cut 5 slits
        across the top of each pastry, and place them on baking sheets, spacing
        2 inches apart.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake for 18 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Cool
        on racks. Dust with confectioners' sugar when cooled if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
